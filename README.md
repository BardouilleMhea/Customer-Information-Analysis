# Customer Information Analysis
 This project aims to explore and analyze [customer information data](customers.csv) to derive valuable insights that can help businesses make informed decisions. The dataset contains customer details such as their first name, last name, email, gender, age, country, purchase behavior, and average order value.

# Data Set
The dataset includes customer information for 30 customers. Each customer's details consist of:
* **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer.
* **first_name**: Customer's first name.
* **last_name**: Customer's last name.
* **email**: Customer's email address.
* **gender**: Customer's gender (Male, Female, Other).
* **age**: Customer's age.
* **country**: Customer's country of residence.
* **purchase_amount**: Total purchase amount made by the customer.
* **order_count**: Total number of orders made by the customer.
* **average_order_value**: The average value of each order made by the customer.

 # Hypotheses to Explore
We have several hypotheses to explore in this dataset:
1. [**Gender and Purchase Behavior**:](gender_purchase_behavior.ipynb) Investigate if there are any differences in purchase behavior (purchase_amount, order_count, average_order_value) between male and female customers.
2. [**Age and Purchase Behavior**:](age_purchase_behavior.ipynb) Examine whether customer age influences their purchase behavior. Analyze how purchase_amount, order_count, and average_order_value vary across different age groups.
3. **Country and Purchase Behavior**: Compare the purchase behavior of customers from different countries (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany).
4. **Email Domain and Purchase Behavior**: Check if the length of email addresses might be related to the purchase behavior of customers.
5. **Customer Loyalty and Purchase Behavior**: Investigate whether more frequent customers (higher order_count) tend to spend more (higher purchase_amount).
6. **Average Order Value Trends**: Observe if there are any trends in the average_order_value over time or based on customer attributes.
7. **Gender Representation**: Examine the gender distribution among customers to understand if there is any gender imbalance.
8. **Age Distribution**: Explore the age distribution of customers to determine if the target audience is concentrated in a specific age range.
9. **Top Spenders**: Identify the top customers based on purchase_amount and analyze their characteristics and purchase behavior.
10. **Customer Geography**: Analyze the distribution of customers across different countries to identify potential geographical markets.

# Usage

The repository contains Python scripts for data analysis and visualization. We use popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for our analysis. The code and Jupyter Notebooks are provided to reproduce the analysis and visualize the results.
